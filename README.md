# BTweet10
A dataset which contains 250 unique Tweets in each topic. This is a balanced form of the UTweet10 dataset. This BTweet10 repository is used for our work **Keyphrase Extraction using Markov Decision Process from Social Media Data** which was published in the proceedings of DSMLAI 2021 held in Namibia. 

# KEST
KEST: keyphrase Extraction for Short Text is proposed using Markov Decision Process (MDP). In KEST, unlike the existing techniques where words were visited in iteration, a path is generated using dynamic chain of highly interconnected words. The robustness of KEST is tested and validated over two different dataset.
